You're seeing **two issues**, and here's how to fix them:

---

## ⚠️ 1. **Warning: Using a password on the command line is insecure**

This is **just a warning**, not an error. You can:

* Accept it as-is (safe in a local script)
* Or use an option file for silent auth (see below)

But this **won’t block the dump**, so you can ignore it unless you're sharing your script.

---

## ❌ 2. **Access denied: need PROCESS privilege**

The real problem is here:

```
mysqldump: Error: 'Access denied; you need (at least one of) the PROCESS privilege(s) for this operation'
```

This error occurs because the `salam_admin` user **does not have the `PROCESS` privilege**, and `mysqldump` is trying to dump table metadata or InnoDB tablespaces.

---

## ✅ Solution

### 🔹 Option A: Skip tablespaces in the dump

Add this flag to your `mysqldump` command:

```bash
--no-tablespaces
```

### ✏️ Updated Script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
mysqldump \
  -u salam_admin -p'peace_25_pwd' \
  --single-transaction \
  --quick \
  --hex-blob \
  --no-tablespaces \
  Alsalam_db > alsalam_dump.sql
```

This tells `mysqldump` **not to request `PROCESS` privilege**, avoiding the error.

---

### 🔹 Option B: Grant the `PROCESS` privilege (optional)

If you have root access to MySQL:

```sql
GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'salam_admin'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

But usually, **Option A (`--no-tablespaces`) is safer and easier**, especially for dumps you plan to import elsewhere.

---

Let me know if you want a version that hides the password securely using a `.my.cnf` config file.

Perfect — now that you have your `alsalam_dump.sql` on the host machine, here’s how to import it into the MySQL server running inside your **Docker container**:

---

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP: Import SQL Dump Into Container's MySQL

### 🔸 1. Confirm container name

From the host, run:

```bash
docker ps
```

Make sure your MySQL container is running, and get its name (we’ll assume it's `alsalam-mysql` — change it if needed).

---

### 🔸 2. Copy the SQL dump file into the container

On your host:

```bash
docker cp alsalam_dump.sql alsalam-mysql:/alsalam_dump.sql
```

---

### 🔸 3. Connect to the container

```bash
docker exec -it alsalam-mysql bash
```

Inside the container, verify the file is there:

```bash
ls /alsalam_dump.sql
```

---

### 🔸 4. Import the dump into the correct database

Inside the container:

```bash
mysql -u salam_admin -p'peace_25_pwd' Alsalam_db < /alsalam_dump.sql
```

> Make sure:
>
> * The database `Alsalam_db` already exists in the container.
> * The user `salam_admin` has access to it.
>
> If not, you can create it:
>
> ```bash
> mysql -u root -p
> CREATE DATABASE Alsalam_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Alsalam_db.* TO 'salam_admin'@'%';
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
> ```

---

### 🔸 5. Clean up (optional)

After successful import:

```bash
rm /alsalam_dump.sql
```

Or from host:

```bash
docker exec alsalam-mysql rm /alsalam_dump.sql
```

---

## ✅ Final Summary

| Task                     | Command                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Copy dump into container | `docker cp alsalam_dump.sql alsalam-mysql:/`             |
| Connect to container     | `docker exec -it alsalam-mysql bash`                     |
| Import dump              | `mysql -u salam_admin -p Alsalam_db < /alsalam_dump.sql` |

Let me know if you want a script that automates this whole import process!
